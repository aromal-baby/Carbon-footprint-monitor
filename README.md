# Carbon-footprint-monitor

A versatile Python application designed to help both organizations and individuals track, analyze, and reduce their carbon footprint. This user-friendly tool enables the collection of environmental impact data, generates insightful reports with personalized reduction strategies, and identifies emission patterns over time.

## Project Overview

The carbon footprint monitor helps users calculate their carbon emissions across multiple categories: transportation, food, waste, energy, and products. Also, provides personalized recommendations based on their emissions which helps them reduce accordingly. The application features real-time global benchmarking via "Our World in Data API", and comprehensive PDF reporting.

## Features

- **Trend Analysis**: Track progress across multiple assessments
- **Multi-Category Analysis**: Transportation, energy, waste, food, and product emissions
- **Dynamic Currency Support**: Automatic currency selection based on user's country
- **Responsive Design**: Professional UI with glassmorphism effects
- **Error Handling**: Robust input validation and error management
- **Visual Reports**: Interactive charts and downloadable PDF reports
- **Global Benchmarking**: Real-time comparisons with country and global averages

## Technical Impolementation

### Carbon Footprint Calculation

The application uses scientifically-backed emission factors:
- **Transportation**: Based on fuel type and distance by air/land, also based on personilized
mode of transports.
- **Energy**: Considers renewable energy percentage.
- **Waste**: Accounts for recycling znd composting.
- **Food**: Diet-specific calculations with local food benefits.
- **Products**: Spendings with secondhand benefits (currency-adjusted)

### API Integration

- **Our World in Data API**: Real-time carbon emissions benchmarking.
- **Fallback System**: Ensures reliability when API is not available.
- **Caching**: 30-day caching for improved performance.

### Key Technologies

- **Backend**: Python Flask.
- **Data Processing**: NumPy for calculations
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib for charts
- **PDF Generation**: ReportLab for professional reports
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6)
- **Styling**: Custom CSS with glassmorphism effects


## Example Usage

```python

   # Example: Calculate carbon footprint
   from app.models.carbon_calculator import CarbonCalculator
   
   calculator = CarbonCalculator()
   user_data = {
       'transportation': {'car': {'weekly_km': 100, 'fuel_type': 'petrol'}},
       'energy': {'electricity': {'monthly_kwh': 300, 'renewable_percentage': 20}}
   }
   
   results = calculator.calculate_footprint(user_data)
   print(f"Total footprint: {results['total']:.2f} kg CO2e")

```
## Testing
